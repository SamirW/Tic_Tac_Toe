# Tic_Tac_Toe
For TeeSpring - Samir Wadhwania

I created everything myself in HTML5, Javascript, and Photoshop with downloaded wood textures.

The only elements that are not mine are the sound files from OpenGameArt.com:

The game is built solely with JS, utilizing Canvas. It also automatically resizes to the browser, so it can be better played on any device.

Enjoy!
